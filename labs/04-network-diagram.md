Network Diagram – Home Lab Environment

This network diagram represents my IT home lab used for hands-on
practice with Active Directory, ServiceNow, and Microsoft 365 labs.

Environment Overview:
- Internet connection through a home router
- VMware Workstation running on a Windows 11 host
- Virtual machines connected using VMware NAT networking

Components:
- Windows Server 2022 (DC01) acting as the Domain Controller
  providing Active Directory and DNS services
- Two Windows client machines (CL01 and CL02) joined to the domain
  for authentication and management testing

Purpose:
This setup simulates a small business IT environment commonly
supported by IT Help Desk and Junior System Administrators.
It allows testing of user authentication, domain policies,
and troubleshooting scenarios in a controlled lab environment.
